A powerful, free hex editor developed using QT C++ by wingsummer.

If you encounter any bugs, please report them on [Github](https://github.com/Wing-summer/WingHexExplorer2/issues).If you have difficulty accessing Github, you may also report them on [Gitee](https://gitee.com/wing-cloud/WingHexExplorer2/issues). If neither works, you can contact me via any way listed on my [CNBlog](https://www.cnblogs.com/wingsummer) announcement board. However, I still prefer GitHub for feedback to facilitate commit comments.

Open-source development is not easy. Donations or contributions to the repository and documentation are welcome. Contributors will be acknowledged on the repository homepage by default:
