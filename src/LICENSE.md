## Preamble 序言

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

GNU Affero通用公共许可证是面向软件及其他作品形式的、自由的著佐权许可证，为针对网络服务器软件情形下保障社区合作而专门设计。

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

大多数软件及其他实用作品的许可协议皆被设计用于剥夺您的分享和修改作品的自由。相反，我们的通用公共许可证则旨在保证您可分享和修改程序的所有版本——以确保它对于所有用户来说都是自由软件。

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

当我们谈及自由软件，强调的是自由，而非免费。我们的通用公共许可证被设计用于确保您可以自由地分发自由软件副本（如您愿意，可以对此收费），确保您能够接收到该自由软件的源代码或者在您想要的时候能够得到，确保您可修改该软件或在新的自由程序中复用该软件的片段，并确保您知悉可以这么做。

Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

采用我们的通用公共许可证的开发者通过两个步骤保障您的权利：（1）在软件上申明版权；（2）向您提供本许可证，以授予您复制、分发和/或修改软件的法律许可。

A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public.

捍卫所有用户的自由还有一个好处，就是如果在程序的其他版本中做出的改进得到广泛应用，上述改进可供其他开发者获取并采用。由此产生的合作使得自由软件的许多开发者感到振奋和鼓舞。但是对于运行在网络服务器上的软件而言，可能无法产生这种合作效果。GNU通用公共许可证允许制作修改版本并可将其运行在服务器上允许公众访问，而无需将源代码向公众发布。

The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases the modified source code becomes available to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version.

GNU Affero通用公共许可证正是为了保证在该情形下社区可以获得修改后的源代码而专门设计。该许可证要求网络服务器的运营者向该服务器的用户提供修改版本的源代码。因此，在可公开访问的服务器上，公开运行修改版本，则需向公众提供修改版本的源代码。

An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.

Affero早先发布过一个许可证，名为Affero通用公共许可证，旨在实现类似的目标。本许可证是另一个许可证，并非Affero GPL的某个版本；不过Affero已发布了Affero GPL的新版本，其允许在本许可证下再许可。

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

复制、分发和修改的确切条款与条件如下。

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS 条款与条件

### 0. Definitions. 定义

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

“本许可证”是指GNU Affero通用公共许可证的第三版。

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

“版权”也指适用于其他种类作品的类似版权的法律，例如半导体掩模。

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

“本程序”是指在本许可证下许可的任何受版权保护的作品。每个被许可人被称为“您”。“被许可人”和“接收者”可以是个人或组织。

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

“修改”作品是指以需获版权许可的方式复制或改编该作品的全部或部分内容，而非制作一个完全相同的副本。由此产生的作品被称为先前作品的“修改版”或“基于”先前作品的作品。

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

“被覆盖作品”是指未作修改的本程序或基于本程序的作品。

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

“传播”作品是指那些您未经许可对作品所实施的将导致您在适用版权法下承担直接或间接侵权责任的任何行为，但在计算机上执行作品或修改私有副本的行为除外。传播行为包括复制、分发（无论修改与否）、向公众提供，在一些国家还包括其他行为。

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

“传递”作品是指使其他各方能够制作或接收副本的任何一种传播方式。仅仅是通过计算机网络与用户交互，而没有转移副本，并不构成传递行为。

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

交互式用户界面对于适当的法律声明的展示应具备一个方便且醒目的特性，从而：（1）展示适当的版权声明，并（2）告知用户：该作品没有任何担保（已提供担保的范围除外）、被许可人可根据本许可证传递该作品，以及如何查阅本许可证的副本。如果该界面呈现的是一个用户命令或选项的列表，例如菜单，则列表中的突出显示的条目即可满足此标准。

### 1. Source Code. 源代码

The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

作品的“源代码”指对作品进行修改的首选形式。“目标代码”指作品的任何非源代码形式。

A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

“标准接口”指由公认的标准机构定义的官方标准的接口，或者对于某一特定编程语言的接口而言，是指在使用该语言的开发者中广泛使用的接口。

The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

可执行作品中的“系统库”不是指整个程序，而是涵盖此等内容：(a)以通常形式和“主部件”打包到一起却并非后者一部分，且(b)仅为使作品与“主部件”可一起使用，或为实现一个标准接口（该接口的实现已以源代码形式向公众提供）。“主部件”在这里指该可执行作品运行依赖的特定操作系统（如有）的必要部件（内核、窗口系统等）、生成该作品的编译器，或运行所需的目标代码解释器。

The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

目标代码形式的作品的“对应源代码”是指生成、安装及运行（对于可执行作品）目标代码以及修改作品所需的所有源代码，包括控制前述活动的脚本。但它不包括作品的“系统库”，或在执行前述活动时通常被不经修改地使用、但不属于该作品组成部分的通用工具或普遍可得的自由程序。例如，“对应源代码”包括与作品源文件相关的接口定义文件、及专为该作品所需而设计的共享库和动态链接子程序（比如与作品的其他部分之间有着紧密数据通信或控制流的这些子程序）的源代码。

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

“对应源代码”不需要包括用户能从“对应源代码”其他部分自动重新生成的任何内容。

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

源代码形式的作品的“对应源代码”即为该作品本身。

### 2. Basic Permissions. 基础许可

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

本许可证授予的所有权利在本程序的版权保护期内授予，且在满足所述条件的情况下不可撤销。本许可证明确认可对您运行未经修改的本程序的无限制许可。仅在运行被覆盖作品所产生的输出（鉴于其内容）也构成被覆盖作品的情况下，该输出才被本许可证覆盖。本许可证认可您享有合理使用的权利或版权法所规定的其他同等权利。

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

只要您的许可证仍然有效，您就可以无条件地制作、运行和传播您没有传递的被覆盖作品。您仅可以以委托他人专门为您修改作品或为您提供运行该作品的设备为目的将被覆盖作品传递给他人，只要您在传递所有您不掌控版权的材料时遵守了本许可证条款。在您的指导和控制下，那些因此为您制作或运行被覆盖作品的人必须完全代表您，且禁止其在与您关系之外制作您的版权材料的任何副本。

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

只有在下述条件下，才允许在任何其他情况下传递被覆盖作品。分许可并不被允许；第10条款的规定使分许可没有必要。

### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law 保护用户的法律权利免受反规避法限制

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

不论是根据为满足1996年12月20日通过的《世界知识产权组织版权条约》第11条规定义务而制定的任何法律，还是根据禁止或限制规避这些措施的类似法律，被覆盖作品均不得被视为有效技术措施的一部分。

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

在您传递被覆盖作品时，即表明您放弃任何禁止规避技术措施的法律权力，只要这种规避是通过对被覆盖作品行使本许可证下的权利而实现的；且表明您放弃任何限制（用户）操作或修改作品的意图，不会以之对该作品的用户强制执行您或第三方禁止规避技术措施的合法权利。

### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. 传递逐字不差的副本

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

您可以通过任何媒介传递您所收到的本程序源代码的逐字不差的副本，只要您在每份副本上醒目且适当地发布了合适的版权声明；应完整保留所有本许可证的声明及根据第7条款添加的适用于代码的任何非许可条款的声明；应完整保留所有无担保的声明；并将本许可证副本和本程序一起交给所有接收者。

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

您可有偿或无偿传递每一份副本，您也可有偿提供支持或担保。

### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. 传递源代码修改版

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

您可根据第4条款的规定以源代码形式传递基于本程序的作品、或用于从本程序产生前述作品而做的（对本程序的）修改，只要您同时满足了以下条件：

- a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

    该作品中必须有显著声明，声明您修改了它，并给出相关日期。

- b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.

    该作品中必须有显著声明，说明它是基于本许可证以及任何根据第7条添加的条件而发布。本条要求构成对第4条中“完整保留所有声明”要求的变更。

- c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    您必须在本许可证下将整个作品作为一个整体，授权给持有副本的任何人。因此本许可证与根据第7条而附加的任何条款一起，将适用于整个作品，及其所有部分，无论它们是如何打包的。本许可证不允许以任何其他方式许可该作品，但不会使您单独收到的许可无效。

- d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

    如果作品有交互式用户界面，每个界面都必须展示适当的法律声明；但是，如果本程序的交互式界面并不展示适当的法律声明，您的作品则不需要使其展示。

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

被覆盖作品与其他单独且独立的作品（其在本质上不属于被覆盖作品的扩展，且未与之结合以构成一个更大的程序）在同一存储或分发介质中的汇编,被称为“聚合体”——如果/且该汇编内容及其产生的版权对用户访问作品或相关权利的限制，并不超出其中每个作品所许可的限度。将被覆盖作品置于聚合体中并不会导致本许可证适用于聚合体的其他部分。

### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. 传递非源代码形式（的作品）

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

您可根据第4条和第5条的规定，以目标代码形式传递被覆盖作品，只要您也根据本许可证的规定以如下方式之一传递了机器可读的“对应源代码”：

- a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

    传递包含或内嵌目标代码的实物产品（包括物理分发介质）时，应将对应源代码存储在通常用于软件交换的耐用物理介质上随附提供。

- b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    传递包含或内嵌目标代码的实物产品（包括物理分发介质）时应随附书面要约——该要约有效期至少为三年，且只要您为该型号产品提供备件或客户支持，该要约就持续有效——以向任何持有目标代码的人提供：（1）在通常用于软件交换的耐用物理介质上的，该产品中本许可证覆盖下的所有软件的对应源代码副本，可收取不超过源代码实物传递的合理费用，或（2）从网络服务器上免费复制对应源代码的权限。

- c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

    传递目标代码的单个副本并附上一份提供“对应源代码”的书面要约副本。该替代方式仅允许偶尔且非商业性地使用，且仅在您依据第6b小节收到附带此要约的目标代码的情况下允许。

- d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    通过提供从指定地点（免费或收费）获取的途径来传递目标代码，并以同样的方式通过同一地点等同提供“对应源代码”的访问且不收费。您无需要求接收者在复制目标代码的同时复制“对应源代码”。如果在网络服务器上复制目标代码，“对应源代码”可置于支持等同复制设备的另一台服务器上（由您或第三方运营），但您必须在目标代码旁持续清晰地指示，说明可以找到“对应源代码”的地点。无论“对应源代码”置于哪个服务器上，您皆有义务确保该服务器随时可用以满足这些要求。

- e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

    使用点对点（P2P）的传输方式传递目标代码，但您必须告知对等方，该作品的目标代码及“对应源代码”根据第6条d)款被免费提供给公众的地点。

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

系统库作为目标代码可分离的一部分——其源代码不属于“对应源代码”——无需被包含在被传递的目标代码作品中。

A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

“用户产品”是（1）“消费品”，即通常被用于个人、家庭或家用目的任何有形个人财产，或（2）被设计或销售用于居家的任何产品。在确认一个产品是否是“消费品”时，存疑情形应倾向于判定为符合（消费品定义）。对于特定用户收到的特定产品，“通常使用”指对该类产品的典型或常见用途，不考虑特定用户的身份或被特定用户实际、预期或被预期使用该产品的方式。一个产品无论是否有大量的商业、工业或非消费用途都被视为“消费品”，除非这种用途是该产品的唯一重要使用方式。

“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

用户产品的“安装信息”是指基于对应源代码的修改版本、安装和执行该用户产品中的被覆盖作品修改版本所需的任何方法、程序、授权密钥或其他信息。这些信息必须足以确保修改后目标代码的持续运行在任何情况下都不会仅仅因为进行过修改而被阻止或干扰。

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

如您在“用户产品”中，或随“用户产品”一起，或专门用于“用户产品”传递本条规定下的目标代码作品，该传递作为交易的一部分——在该交易中占有和使用“用户作品”的权利永久地或在固定期限内转让给接收者（无论该交易如何定性）——那么根据本条规定传递该“对应源代码”必须附带“安装信息”。但如您或任何第三方皆未保留在“用户产品”上安装修改版目标代码的能力（例如，作品安装在ROM中），则该要求不适用。

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

要求提供安装信息并不包括，持续为已被接收者修改或安装的作品或者已被修改或安装的“用户产品”来提供支持服务、担保或更新。当修改本身实质上不利地影响网络的运行或违反了网络通信的规则和协议时，访问网络可能被拒绝。

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

根据本条款传递的对应源代码和提供的安装信息必须是公开记录的格式（并以源代码形式向公众提供实现），并且不需要解包、读取或复制的特殊密码或密钥。

### 7. Additional Terms. 附加条款

“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

“附加许可”是对本许可证条款的补充，对其一个或多个条件作出例外规定。如果“附加许可”适用于整个程序，其在适用法律下有效的部分应被视为包含于本许可证内。如果“附加许可”只适用于本程序的一部分，则该部分可以根据“附加许可”单独使用，但整个程序仍仅受本许可证约束而不考虑“附加许可”。

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

当您传递一份被覆盖作品的副本时，您可以选择从该副本或其任何部分删除任何“附加许可”（在某些情况下，“附加许可”可能被写成一旦您修改作品则应删除“附加许可”）。您可以将“附加许可”放在被您添加到被覆盖作品中的材料上，如果您已经或可以对该材料给予适当的版权许可。

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

尽管本许可证有任何其他条款，对于被您添加到被覆盖作品中的材料，您可以（如您得到该材料的版权持有人的授权）用如下条款来补充本许可证的条款：

- a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    以不同于本许可证第15条和第16条的条款去免除担保或限制责任；或

- b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    要求在该材料中或在包含该材料的作品所展示的“适当法律声明”中，保留特定的适当的法律声明或作者署名；或

- c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    禁止虚报该材料的来源，或要求以合理方式将该材料的修改版标注为与原始版本不同；或

- d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or

    限制为宣传目的使用许可人或材料作者的姓名；或

- e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    拒绝授予商标法下某些商号、商标及服务标识的使用权利；或

- f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

    要求向接收者传递材料（或修改后的材料）并基于合同设定责任的任何人，向许可人和作者赔偿基于合同设定直接强加于许可人和作者的任何责任。

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

所有其他非许可性的附加条款均为视为第10条款意义上的“进一步限制”。如果您收到的本程序或其任何部分包含一个声明，说明它受本许可证管辖并同时附上“进一步限制”的条款，您可以自行删除该条款。如果一个许可文件包含“进一步限制”但允许根据本许可证再许可或传递，您则可将该受许可文件管辖的材料添加到被覆盖作品中，只要在此类再许可或传递中并不存在“进一步限制”。

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

如果您按照本条款的规定对被覆盖作品增加了条款，您必须在相关的源文件中说明适用于这些源文件的附加条款，或给一个说明指明适用条款的位置。

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

附加条款，无论是许可性的还是非许可性的，可以以单独的书面许可形式说明，或者作为例外情况形式说明；上述要求对这两种形式均适用。

### 8. Termination. 权利的终止

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

除非本许可证明确规定，您不得传播或修改被覆盖作品。任何试图以其他方式传播或修改被覆盖作品的行为均为无效，并将自动终止您在本许可证下的权利（包括根据第11条3款授予的任何专利许可）。

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

但是，如您停止所有违反本许可证的行为，那么您从特定版权持有人处获得的许可将被（1）暂时恢复，除非版权持有人明确地、最终地终止对您的许可；或（2）永久恢复，如在您停止违反行为后60天内版权持有人未能以某种合理方式通知您曾违反本许可证。

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

此外，如您首次收到了版权持有人以某种合理方式关于您违反本许可证的通知，且您在收到通知后30天内纠正了违反行为，则您从特定版权持有人处获得的许可将被永久恢复。

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

根据本条款终止您的权利，并不终止那些根据本许可证从您处获得副本或权利的各方的许可。如果您的权利已被终止且没有永久恢复，您就没有资格根据第10条款获得相同材料的新许可。

### 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. 持有副本并不需要接受本许可证

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

您无需为了接收或运行本程序副本而接受本许可证。仅是因为使用点对点传输接收副本而发生的被覆盖作品的辅助传播，您也无需接受本许可证。然而，除了本许可证以外，没有任何其他文件授权您传播或修改任何被覆盖作品。如果您不接受本许可证，这些行为（传播和修改）即构成版权侵权。因此，如果您修改或传播被覆盖作品，就表示您接受了本许可证。

### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. 对下游接收者的自动许可

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

每当您传递一个被覆盖作品时，接收者都自动从原始许可人处获得一个许可，以根据本许可证运行、修改和传播该作品。您没有义务要求第三方遵守本许可证。

An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

“实体交易”是指转移一个组织或其实质上所有资产的控制权，或拆分一个组织或合并多个组织的交易。如果一个“实体交易”导致被覆盖作品的传播，那么每个收到作品副本的交易方也会收到该方的利益前身根据上一段规定已有的或可以授予的作品许可，以及从利益前身处获得的占有作品“对应源代码”的权利，如果利益前身拥有该权利或通过合理努力能够获得该权利。

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

您不得对行使本许可证授予或确认的权利施加“进一步限制”。例如，您不能对行使本许可证所授予的权利而收取许可费、使用费或其他费用，也不得提起诉讼（包括诉讼中提出交叉诉讼或反诉）去主张对本程序或其任何部分的制造、使用、销售、许诺销售或进口侵犯了任何专利权利要求。

### 11. Patents. 专利权

A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.

根据本许可证授权使用本程序或本程序所基于的作品的版权持有人是“贡献者”。如此被授权的作品被称为贡献者的“贡献者版本”。

A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

贡献者的“必要专利权利要求”是指贡献者拥有或控制的、无论已取得或后续将取得、以本许可证允许的某种形式制造、使用或销售其贡献者版本而将被侵犯的所有专利权利要求，但不包括仅因贡献者版本的进一步修改而将被侵犯的权利要求。在本定义中，“控制”包括以符合本许可证要求的方式授予专利分许可的权利。

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

每个贡献者根据其必要专利权利要求，授予您非排他的、全球范围的、免许可费的专利许可，以制造、使用、销售、许诺销售、进口及以其他方式运行、修改和传播其贡献者版本内容。

In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

在以下三段中，“专利许可”是指不进行专利维权的任何明确同意或承诺（例如，明确允许使用专利或不起诉专利侵权），无论其如何命名。向一方“授予”专利许可，即表示作出不对该方进行专利维权的同意或承诺。

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

如您传递被覆盖作品时，明知道其依赖某一专利许可，且该作品“对应源代码”并没有通过公开的网络服务器或其他容易获得的方式以供任何人根据本许可证的条款免费复制，那么您必须：或者（1）以上述方式提供“对应源代码”，或者（2）安排放弃该特定作品的专利许可权益，或者（3）以符合本许可证要求的方式，将专利许可扩展到所有的下游接收者。“明知依赖”是指您事实上知道如果没有专利许可，您在某个国家传递被覆盖作品或您的接收者在某个国家使用被覆盖作品将会侵犯一项或多项可识别专利，且您有理由相信前述专利在该国有效。

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

如果依照或根据某一交易或安排，您传递或通过促成传递而传播被覆盖作品，并向接收被覆盖作品的某些当事方授予专利许可，以授权他们使用、传播、修改或传递被覆盖作品的特定副本，那么您授予的专利许可将自动扩展到被覆盖作品和基于该作品的作品的所有接收者。

A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

如果某一专利许可在其覆盖范围内未包含本许可证具体授予的一项或多项权利、禁止行使前述权利、或以不行使前述权利为条件，则该专利许可是 "歧视性的"。如果您与第三方达成有关软件分发的某一安排，根据该安排，您为您传递作品的范围向第三方付款，且据此安排第三方向任何从您处接收所覆盖作品的当事方授予：(a)与您传递的所覆盖作品的副本（或基于这些副本制作的副本）相关联的歧视性的专利许可，或者(b)主要是为包含所覆盖作品的特定产品或汇编而作出且与之相关联的歧视性的专利许可，则您不能传递所覆盖作品，除非在2007年3月28日之前您已达成了该安排，或已授予该专利许可。

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

本许可证中的任何内容都不应被解释为排除或限制您根据适用的专利法可能得到的任何默示许可或其他侵权抗辩理由。

### 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. 不得牺牲他人的自由

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

如果您被施加的条件（无论是通过法院命令、协议或其他方式）与本许可证的条件存在矛盾，这也不能成为您不履行本许可证条件的借口。如果您在传递被覆盖作品时，不能同时满足本许可证下的义务和任何其他相关义务，则您不得传递它。例如，如果您同意了某些条款，其使您有义务对接收您传递的本程序的人的进一步传递行为收取许可费，那么您能够满足那些条款和本许可证的唯一方法是完全避免传递本程序。

### 13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License. 远程网络交互；和GNU通用公共许可证一起使用

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software. This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.

尽管本许可证存在其他条款，如果您修改本程序，您的修改版本必须以显著的方式让通过计算机网络与本程序远程交互（如果您的版本支持这种交互）的所有用户，以便于复制软件的标准或通常方式，从网络服务器上免费获取您的版本的对应源代码。对应源代码应当包含根据下一段规定纳入的、受GNU通用公共许可证第三版覆盖的任何作品的对应源代码。

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

尽管本许可证存在其他条款，您有权将任何被覆盖作品与GNU通用公共许可证第三版下许可的作品进行链接或组合为单一组合作品，并传递由此产生的作品。本许可证的条款将继续适用于被覆盖作品，但与之组合的原作品仍将受GNU通用公共许可证第三版的约束。

### 14. Revised Versions of this License. 本许可证的修订版

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

自由软件基金会可能会不时发布GNU Affero通用公共许可证的修订版和/或新版本。这些新版本在精神上与当前版本相似，但在细节上可能有所不同，并旨在解决新的问题或关注点。

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

每个版本都有一个不同的版本号。如果本程序指定其适用GNU Affero通用公共许可证的某个特定版本“或任何后续版本”，您可选择遵循该编号版本或自由软件基金会发布的任何后续版本的条款和条件。如果本程序没有指定GNU Affero通用公共许可证的版本号，您可以选择自由软件基金会曾经发布的任何版本。

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

如果本程序指定代理方来决定使用GNU Affero通用公共许可证的哪个未来版本，那么该代理方接受某个版本许可证的公开声明即永久授权您在本程序中选择该版本。

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

后续许可证版本可能给您额外或不同的许可。但任何作者或版权持有人都不因您选择遵循后续许可证版本而承担额外义务。

### 15. Disclaimer of Warranty. 免责声明

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

在适用法律允许的范围内，本程序没有任何担保。除非另有书面说明，否则版权持有人和/或其他各方“按原样”提供本程序，而不提供任何明示担保或默示担保，包括但不限于对适销性和特定目的适用性的默示担保。关于本程序的质量和性能的全部风险皆由您承担。如果本程序确有缺陷，您将承担所有必要的服务、维修或修正的费用。

### 16. Limitation of Liability. 责任限制

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

在任何情况下，除非适用法律要求或经书面同意，否则任何版权持有人或任何其他按照上述许可修改和/或传递本程序的一方皆不对您的损失负责，包括因不再使用或无法使用本程序而引起的任何一般的、特殊的、偶然的或继发性的损失（包括但不限于数据丢失或数据偏差造成的损失、或本程序无法与任何其他程序一起运行使您或第三方遭受的损失），即便该持有人或其他人已被告知此种损失的可能性。

### 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. 对第15条和第16条的解释

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

如果以上规定的免责声明和责任限制不能根据其条款在当地产生法律效力，除非本程序副本附带收费的担保或担责承诺，否则审理法院应适用与"绝对放弃与本程序有关的一切民事责任"最为接近的当地法律。
